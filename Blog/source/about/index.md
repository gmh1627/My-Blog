Hello! My name is Maohang Gao（高茂航）, and I am from [Zhanjiang](https://kangaroogao.com/2020/08/22/%E9%9B%B7%E5%B7%9E%EF%BC%8C%E9%9B%B7%E5%B7%9E/), Guangdong Province, a coastal city located at the southernmost tip of mainland China.

I am currently a junior student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei, Anhui Province, majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence, including deep learning and its applications in natural language processing (large language models). I am passionate about exploring the latest advancements in these fields and applying them to solve real-world problems. Please visit my [academic homepage](https://gmh1627.github.io/) for more information.

In my free time, I enjoy [reading](https://kangaroogao.com/tags/%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB/), exercising (long-distance running and table tennis), [traveling](https://kangaroogao.com/tags/%E8%A1%8C%E8%B5%B0%E8%B6%B3%E8%BF%B9/), listening to music and participating in various [cultural activities](https://kangaroogao.com/2024/11/16/%E6%96%87%E8%89%BA%E4%BD%9C%E5%93%81%E3%80%81%E6%B4%BB%E5%8A%A8/) such as watching [movies](https://kangaroogao.com/movies/) and listening to stand-up comedy.
